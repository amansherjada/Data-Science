    "## Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a type of regression analysis used for predicting the probability of a binary outcome based on one or more predictor variables. Despite its name, it is actually a classification algorithm rather than a regression algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Logistic Regression, the dependent variable is binary, meaning it has only two possible outcomes (e.g., 0 or 1, yes or no, true or false). The goal of logistic regression is to model the probability that a given instance belongs to a particular class. This probability is modeled using a logistic function (also called the sigmoid function), which ensures that the predicted probabilities lie between 0 and 1.\n",

    "\n",
    "The logistic regression model estimates the values of the coefficients \tβ_1, β_2, β_3,.....β_n using maximum likelihood estimation or other optimization techniques. These coefficients represent the relationship between the independent variables and the log-odds of the dependent variable being 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is widely used in various fields, including medicine, finance, marketing, and social sciences, for tasks such as predicting whether a customer will churn, whether an email is spam or not, or whether a patient has a disease based on certain diagnostic tests."

    "### Perceptron Trick\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perceptron Trick is a technique used to update the weights of a perceptron (a type of artificial neuron) in order to correctly classify input data points. It is a fundamental concept in the field of neural networks and forms the basis for learning in single-layer perceptrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how the Perceptron Trick works:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialization:** Initially, the weights of the perceptron are randomly initialized or set to some initial values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Iterative Update:** For each training example, the perceptron makes a prediction based on the current weights and compares it to the true label. If the prediction is incorrect, the weights are adjusted using the Perceptron Trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Calculation:** If the perceptron misclassifies an input example, the weights are adjusted in the direction that would reduce the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Weight Update:** The weights are updated according to the following formula:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   `w_i := w_i + α × (y - ŷ) × x_i`\n",
    "\n",
    "   - w_i is the weight associated with the \\( i \\)-th feature.\n",
    "   - alpha is the learning rate, controlling the size of the update step.\n",
    "   - y is the true label of the input example.\n",
    "   - ŷ is the predicted label of the input example.\n",
    "   - x_i is the value of the \\( i \\)-th feature of the input example.\n",
    "\n",
    "   This formula updates the weights in the direction that would reduce the error, scaled by the learning rate \\( \\alpha \\).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Iteration:** The process is repeated for multiple iterations (epochs) or until convergence, where the perceptron makes predictions that are consistent with the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Perceptron Trick is a simple yet effective algorithm for training a perceptron to learn linear decision boundaries. However, it has limitations, such as being unable to learn non-linear decision boundaries and being sensitive to the order of training examples. More advanced techniques, such as gradient descent and backpropagation, are used to train multi-layer perceptrons and deep neural networks."
